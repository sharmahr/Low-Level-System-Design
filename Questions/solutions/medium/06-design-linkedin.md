Explanation:
1. The code is organized into different classes and interfaces based on the main features of the professional networking platform.

2. The `User` class represents a user in the system, with properties such as name, email, and password. The `UserRepository` interface defines methods for user-related data access, and the `UserService` class contains the business logic for user registration and authentication.

3. The `Profile` class represents a user's profile, with properties such as profile picture, headline, summary, experience, education, and skills. The `ProfileRepository` interface defines methods for profile-related data access, and the `ProfileService` class contains the business logic for retrieving and updating user profiles.

4. The `Connection` class represents a connection between two users, with properties such as user IDs and connection status. The `ConnectionRepository` interface defines methods for connection-related data access, and the `ConnectionService` class contains the business logic for sending, accepting, and declining connection requests.

5. The `Message` class represents a message sent between users, with properties such as sender, receiver, content, and timestamp. The `MessageRepository` interface defines methods for message-related data access, and the `MessageService` class contains the business logic for sending and retrieving messages.

6. The `JobPosting` class represents a job posting, with properties such as title, description, requirements, location, and employer ID. The `JobPostingRepository` interface defines methods for job posting-related data access, and the `JobPostingService` class contains the business logic for creating and retrieving job postings.

7. The `SearchService` class contains the logic for searching users and job postings based on relevant criteria. It depends on the `UserRepository` and `JobPostingRepository` interfaces for data access.

8. The `Notification` class represents a notification, with properties such as user ID, notification type, message, and timestamp. The `NotificationRepository` interface defines methods for notification-related data access, and the `NotificationService` class contains the business logic for sending and retrieving notifications.

Design Patterns Used:
- Repository Pattern: The code uses the Repository pattern to separate the data access logic from the business logic. The repository interfaces (`UserRepository`, `ProfileRepository`, `ConnectionRepository`, `MessageRepository`, `JobPostingRepository`, `NotificationRepository`) define the methods for data access, and the corresponding service classes contain the business logic and depend on these repositories.

- Dependency Injection: The code follows the Dependency Injection principle by passing the required dependencies (repositories) to the service classes through their constructors. This allows for loose coupling and easier testing.

- Separation of Concerns: The code separates the concerns by organizing the classes and interfaces based on their responsibilities. Each class and interface has a specific purpose and encapsulates the related functionality.

To ensure scalability and performance, the system can be designed using a distributed architecture, with the use of load balancers, caching mechanisms, and efficient data storage solutions. The repositories can be implemented using database technologies that support scalability, such as NoSQL databases or distributed SQL databases.

Real-time notifications can be implemented using technologies such as WebSocket or a message queue system like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
