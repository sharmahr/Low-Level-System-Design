# Designing an Online Shopping System Like Amazon

## Requirements
1. The online shopping service should allow users to browse products, add them to the shopping cart, and place orders.
2. The system should support multiple product categories and provide search functionality.
3. Users should be able to manage their profiles, view order history, and track order status.
4. The system should handle inventory management and update product availability accordingly.
5. The system should support multiple payment methods and ensure secure transactions.
6. The system should handle concurrent user requests and ensure data consistency.
7. The system should be scalable to handle a large number of products and users.
8. The system should provide a user-friendly interface for a seamless shopping experience.

Explanation:
1. The `Product` class represents a product in the online shopping service, with properties such as ID, name, description, price, quantity, and category.

2. The `ShoppingCart` class represents a user's shopping cart, which stores the selected products and their quantities. It provides methods to add and remove items from the cart.

3. The `Order` class represents an order placed by a user, with properties such as ID, user ID, order items, total amount, status, and creation date.

4. The `OrderItem` class represents an item in an order, with properties such as product ID, quantity, and price.

5. The `PaymentProcessor` interface defines the contract for processing payments. It has different implementations, such as `CreditCardPaymentProcessor` and `PayPalPaymentProcessor`, which handle specific payment methods.

6. The `InventoryManager` class manages the inventory of products. It provides methods to check product availability and update inventory quantities. It uses synchronization to ensure thread safety and data consistency.

7. The `ProductRepository` class acts as a repository for managing products. It provides methods to retrieve all products, search products based on keywords, and retrieve a product by its ID.

8. The `OrderRepository` class acts as a repository for managing orders. It provides methods to save orders, retrieve orders by ID, and retrieve orders by user ID.

9. The `ShoppingService` class is the main service class that orchestrates the shopping process. It depends on the `ProductRepository`, `OrderRepository`, `InventoryManager`, and `PaymentProcessor` classes. It provides methods to get all products, search products, and place orders.

10. The `placeOrder` method in the `ShoppingService` class handles the order placement process. It checks product availability, creates order items, calculates the total amount, creates the order, and processes the payment. It uses synchronization to ensure thread safety and data consistency.

Design Patterns Used:
- Repository Pattern: The `ProductRepository` and `OrderRepository` classes follow the Repository pattern. They encapsulate the data access logic and provide a clean interface for retrieving and storing products and orders.

- Dependency Injection: The `ShoppingService` class uses constructor injection to receive its dependencies (`ProductRepository`, `OrderRepository`, `InventoryManager`, `PaymentProcessor`). This allows for loose coupling and easier testing.

- Strategy Pattern: The `PaymentProcessor` interface and its implementations (`CreditCardPaymentProcessor`, `PayPalPaymentProcessor`) follow the Strategy pattern. They encapsulate different payment strategies and allow for easy extension and interchangeability of payment methods.

Scalability and Concurrency:
- The `InventoryManager` class uses synchronization to ensure thread safety when checking and updating inventory quantities. This prevents concurrent access and ensures data consistency.

- The `placeOrder` method in the `ShoppingService` class uses synchronization to handle concurrent order placement requests. It ensures that the inventory is updated atomically and prevents overselling of products.

- To handle a large number of products and users, the system can be designed to scale horizontally by deploying multiple instances of the application servers and using load balancers to distribute the traffic.

- The data storage layer can be designed to use distributed databases or NoSQL databases that can handle high read and write throughput and provide scalability.

User Interface:
- The user interface can be implemented using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular) to provide a user-friendly and seamless shopping experience.

- The user interface can communicate with the backend services (e.g., `ShoppingService`) through REST APIs or other communication protocols to retrieve product information, manage the shopping cart, and place orders.

This low-level design provides a basic structure for the online shopping service that meets the given requirements. It can be further enhanced with additional features such as user authentication, product reviews, wishlist management, and more advanced search and filtering capabilities.

The use of design patterns such as Repository, Dependency Injection, and Strategy allows for modularity, extensibility, and maintainability of the codebase. The synchronization mechanisms ensure data consistency and handle concurrent user requests effectively.

Overall, this design aims to provide a scalable and robust solution for the online shopping service, taking into account the requirements of product browsing, shopping cart management, order placement, inventory management, and secure payment processing.
