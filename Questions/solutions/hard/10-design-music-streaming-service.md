# Designing an Online Music Streaming Service Like Spotify

## Requirements
1. The music streaming service should allow users to browse and search for songs, albums, and artists.
2. Users should be able to create and manage playlists.
3. The system should support user authentication and authorization.
4. Users should be able to play, pause, skip, and seek within songs.
5. The system should recommend songs and playlists based on user preferences and listening history.
6. The system should handle concurrent requests and ensure smooth streaming experience for multiple users.
7. The system should be scalable and handle a large volume of songs and users.
8. The system should be extensible to support additional features such as social sharing and offline playback.

Explanation:
1. The code defines several classes to represent the key entities in the music streaming service, such as `User`, `Song`, and `Playlist`.

2. The `MusicCatalog` interface and its implementation `MusicCatalogImpl` handle the browsing and searching of songs, albums, and artists. It provides methods to search for songs, retrieve songs by album, and retrieve songs by artist.

3. The `AudioPlayer` interface and its implementation `AudioPlayerImpl` handle the audio playback functionalities, such as playing, pausing, resuming, stopping, and seeking within songs.

4. The `RecommendationEngine` interface and its implementation `RecommendationEngineImpl` handle the generation of song and playlist recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.

5. The `MusicStreamingService` class acts as the main service layer, orchestrating the interactions between different components. It provides methods for user registration, user login, song searching, audio playback, playlist management, and recommendation retrieval.

6. The `MusicStreamingApp` class contains the main method and demonstrates the usage of the music streaming service by registering a user, logging in, searching for songs, playing a song, creating a playlist, adding a song to the playlist, and retrieving recommended songs and playlists.

Design Patterns Used:
- Repository Pattern: The `MusicCatalog` interface and its implementation `MusicCatalogImpl` follow the Repository pattern. They provide an abstraction layer for accessing and retrieving song data, encapsulating the data access logic.

- Facade Pattern: The `MusicStreamingService` class acts as a facade, providing a simplified interface to the clients and encapsulating the complex interactions between different components of the music streaming service.

- Dependency Injection: The `MusicStreamingService` class receives its dependencies (`MusicCatalog`, `AudioPlayer`, and `RecommendationEngine`) through constructor injection. This promotes loose coupling and allows for easy substitution of different implementations.

The use of design patterns in this music streaming service implementation provides several benefits:
- The Repository pattern abstracts the data access logic, making it easier to change the underlying data storage implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
- The Facade pattern simplifies the interface for clients, hiding the complexities of the underlying subsystems and providing a unified entry point.
- Dependency Injection enables loose coupling between components, making the system more modular, testable, and maintainable.

To handle concurrent requests and ensure a smooth streaming experience, techniques such as caching, load balancing, and efficient data retrieval mechanisms should be employed.

Scalability can be achieved by distributed song storage, content delivery networks (CDNs), and horizontal scaling of the system components.

Extensibility can be facilitated by designing the system with a modular architecture, allowing new features to be added without significant modifications to the existing codebase.

This low-level design provides a basic structure for the music streaming service that meets the given requirements. It can be further enhanced with additional features such as user profiles, social sharing, offline playback, and advanced recommendation algorithms.
