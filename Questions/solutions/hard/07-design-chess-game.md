# Designing a Chess Game

## Requirements
1. The chess game should follow the standard rules of chess.
2. The game should support two players, each controlling their own set of pieces.
3. The game board should be represented as an 8x8 grid, with alternating black and white squares.
4. Each player should have 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.
5. The game should validate legal moves for each piece and prevent illegal moves.
6. The game should detect checkmate and stalemate conditions.
7. The game should handle player turns and allow players to make moves alternately.
8. The game should provide a user interface for players to interact with the game.

Explanation:
1. The code defines several classes to represent the different components of the chess game.

2. The `PieceType` and `PieceColor` enums define the types and colors of the chess pieces.

3. The `Piece` class is an abstract base class that represents a chess piece. It has a `color` attribute and an abstract method `getValidMoves` that should be implemented by each specific piece class.

4. The `King`, `Queen`, `Rook`, `Bishop`, `Knight`, and `Pawn` classes extend the `Piece` class and implement the `getValidMoves` method according to the rules of chess for each piece.

5. The `Position` class represents a position on the chess board, with `row` and `col` attributes.

6. The `Board` class represents the chess board. It initializes the board with pieces, provides methods to get and set pieces on the board, and checks for valid moves, checks, checkmates, and stalemates.

7. The `Player` class represents a player in the game. It has a `color` attribute and a `makeMove` method that makes a move on the board.

8. The `Game` class represents the overall game logic. It initializes the board, players, and current player. The `play` method runs the game loop, handling player moves, switching players, and checking for game-ending conditions.

9. The `ChessUI` class represents the user interface for the chess game. It provides methods to display the board, get player moves, and show messages to the user.

10. The `Main` class contains the main method, which creates an instance of the `Game` class, initializes the user interface, and starts the game.

Design Patterns Used:
- Abstract Factory Pattern: The `Piece` class serves as an abstract factory for creating different types of chess pieces. Each specific piece class (`King`, `Queen`, `Rook`, `Bishop`, `Knight`, `Pawn`) is a concrete product that implements the `getValidMoves` method.

- Template Method Pattern: The `Game` class defines the overall structure of the game flow in the `play` method, while leaving the implementation of specific steps (e.g., getting player moves) to be defined in collaborating classes.

- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern: The code separates the game logic (model) in the `Board`, `Piece`, and `Game` classes, the user interface (view) in the `ChessUI` class, and the control flow (controller) in the `Main` class and the `Game` class.

The use of design patterns in this chess game implementation provides several benefits:
- The Abstract Factory pattern allows for easy creation and management of different types of chess pieces, promoting code reusability and extensibility.
- The Template Method pattern provides a structured approach to defining the game flow, allowing for customization and flexibility in certain steps while maintaining a consistent overall structure.
- The MVC pattern separates the concerns of the game logic, user interface, and control flow, making the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to modify or extend.

This low-level design provides a basic structure for the chess game that meets the given requirements. It can be further enhanced with additional features such as move validation, game saving and loading, AI opponents, and more advanced user interface elements.
