# Designing Snake and Ladder Game

## Requirements
1. The game should be played on a board with numbered cells, typically with 100 cells.
2. The board should have a predefined set of snakes and ladders, connecting certain cells.
3. The game should support multiple players, each represented by a unique game piece.
4. Players should take turns rolling a dice to determine the number of cells to move forward.
5. If a player lands on a cell with the head of a snake, they should slide down to the cell with the tail of the snake.
6. If a player lands on a cell with the base of a ladder, they should climb up to the cell at the top of the ladder.
7. The game should continue until one of the players reaches the final cell on the board.
8. The game should handle multiple game sessions concurrently, allowing different groups of players to play independently.

Certainly! Here's a low-level design for the Snake and Ladder game based on the given requirements, along with explanations of the code and design patterns used:

```java
class Board {
    private int size;
    private List<Snake> snakes;
    private List<Ladder> ladders;

    public Board(int size, List<Snake> snakes, List<Ladder> ladders) {
        this.size = size;
        this.snakes = snakes;
        this.ladders = ladders;
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public int getNextPosition(int currentPosition) {
        for (Snake snake : snakes) {
            if (snake.getHead() == currentPosition) {
                return snake.getTail();
            }
        }
        for (Ladder ladder : ladders) {
            if (ladder.getBase() == currentPosition) {
                return ladder.getTop();
            }
        }
        return currentPosition;
    }
}

class Snake {
    private int head;
    private int tail;

    public Snake(int head, int tail) {
        this.head = head;
        this.tail = tail;
    }

    public int getHead() {
        return head;
    }

    public int getTail() {
        return tail;
    }
}

class Ladder {
    private int base;
    private int top;

    public Ladder(int base, int top) {
        this.base = base;
        this.top = top;
    }

    public int getBase() {
        return base;
    }

    public int getTop() {
        return top;
    }
}

class Player {
    private String name;
    private int position;

    public Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = 0;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getPosition() {
        return position;
    }

    public void setPosition(int position) {
        this.position = position;
    }
}

class Dice {
    private int numFaces;
    private Random random;

    public Dice(int numFaces) {
        this.numFaces = numFaces;
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public int roll() {
        return random.nextInt(numFaces) + 1;
    }
}

class Game {
    private Board board;
    private List<Player> players;
    private Dice dice;
    private int currentPlayerIndex;

    public Game(Board board, List<Player> players, Dice dice) {
        this.board = board;
        this.players = players;
        this.dice = dice;
        this.currentPlayerIndex = 0;
    }

    public void play() {
        while (true) {
            Player currentPlayer = players.get(currentPlayerIndex);
            int roll = dice.roll();
            int newPosition = currentPlayer.getPosition() + roll;

            if (newPosition > board.getSize()) {
                newPosition = board.getSize();
            } else {
                newPosition = board.getNextPosition(newPosition);
            }

            currentPlayer.setPosition(newPosition);
            System.out.println(currentPlayer.getName() + " rolled a " + roll +
                    " and moved to position " + newPosition);

            if (newPosition == board.getSize()) {
                System.out.println(currentPlayer.getName() + " wins!");
                break;
            }

            currentPlayerIndex = (currentPlayerIndex + 1) % players.size();
        }
    }
}

class GameSession {
    private String sessionId;
    private Game game;

    public GameSession(String sessionId, Game game) {
        this.sessionId = sessionId;
        this.game = game;
    }

    public void startGame() {
        game.play();
    }

// Example usage
public class SnakeAndLadderGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Snake> snakes = Arrays.asList(
                new Snake(17, 7),
                new Snake(54, 34),
                new Snake(62, 19),
                new Snake(64, 60),
                new Snake(87, 36),
                new Snake(92, 73),
                new Snake(95, 75),
                new Snake(98, 79)
        );

        List<Ladder> ladders = Arrays.asList(
                new Ladder(1, 38),
                new Ladder(4, 14),
                new Ladder(9, 31),
                new Ladder(21, 42),
                new Ladder(28, 84),
                new Ladder(51, 67),
                new Ladder(72, 91),
                new Ladder(80, 99)
        );

        Board board = new Board(100, snakes, ladders);
        Dice dice = new Dice(6);

        List<Player> players = Arrays.asList(
                new Player("Alice"),
                new Player("Bob"),
                new Player("Charlie")
        );

        GameManager gameManager = new GameManager();
        String sessionId = "game1";
        gameManager.createGameSession(sessionId, board, players, dice);
        gameManager.startGameSession(sessionId);
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. The `Board` class represents the game board with a specified size and a predefined set of snakes and ladders. It provides methods to get the size of the board and determine the next position based on the current position and the presence of snakes or ladders.

2. The `Snake` class represents a snake on the board, with properties for the head and tail positions.

3. The `Ladder` class represents a ladder on the board, with properties for the base and top positions.

4. The `Player` class represents a player in the game, with properties for the player's name and current position on the board.

5. The `Dice` class represents a dice used in the game, with a specified number of faces. It provides a method to roll the dice and generate a random number.

6. The `Game` class represents a single game session. It contains the game board, players, dice, and the current player's turn. The `play` method implements the game logic, where players take turns rolling the dice, moving their positions, and checking for any snakes or ladders. The game continues until a player reaches the final position on the board.

7. The `GameSession` class represents a game session, with properties for the session ID and the associated game instance. It provides a method to start the game.

8. The `GameManager` class manages multiple game sessions. It uses a map to store the game sessions, with the session ID as the key. It provides methods to create a new game session and start a specific game session based on the session ID.

Design Patterns Used:
- Singleton Pattern: The `GameManager` class can be implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance of the game manager exists throughout the application. This allows for centralized management of game sessions.

- Factory Pattern: The `GameManager` class acts as a factory for creating game sessions. It encapsulates the creation logic and provides a method to create a new game session with the necessary dependencies (board, players, dice).

Concurrency:
- The `GameManager` class allows for multiple game sessions to be created and played concurrently. Each game session is independent and can be played by different groups of players.

- To ensure thread safety, the `GameManager` class can use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., synchronized methods or locks) when accessing and modifying the shared data structure (`gameSessions` map).

This low-level design provides a basic structure for the Snake and Ladder game that meets the given requirements. It can be further enhanced with additional features such as user interface, game state persistence, player statistics, and more advanced game variations.

The use of the Singleton pattern ensures a single instance of the game manager for centralized control, while the Factory pattern encapsulates the creation of game sessions. The design allows for multiple game sessions to be played concurrently, providing a scalable solution for the Snake and Ladder game.
