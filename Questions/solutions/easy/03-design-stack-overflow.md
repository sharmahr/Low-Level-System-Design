# Designing Stack Overflow

## Requirements
1. Users should be able to register, log in, and log out of the system.
2. Users can post questions, answer questions, and comment on questions and answers.
3. Questions should have tags associated with them for categorization and easy searching.
4. Users can vote on questions and answers to indicate their relevance and quality.
5. The system should have a reputation system based on user activity and the quality of their contributions.
6. Users can search for questions based on keywords, tags, or user profiles.
7. The system should handle concurrent access and ensure data consistency.

```java
// User class representing a user in the system

Explanation:
- The `User` class represents a user in the system, with attributes such as username, password, and reputation.
- The `Question` class represents a question posted by a user, with attributes such as title, body, author, tags, votes, answers, and comments.
- The `Answer` class represents an answer to a question, with attributes such as body, author, votes, and comments.
- The `Comment` class represents a comment on a question or answer, with attributes such as body and author.
- The `QAPlatform` class represents the Q&A platform itself and contains maps of users and questions. It provides methods for user registration, login, posting questions, posting answers, posting comments, voting, and searching questions.
- The methods in the `QAPlatform` class are synchronized to ensure thread safety and data consistency when handling concurrent access.

Design Patterns Used:
1. Singleton Pattern (optional): The `QAPlatform` class can be implemented as a singleton to ensure only one instance of the platform exists throughout the application.
2. Composition: The `Question` class is composed of `Answer` and `Comment` objects, promoting code reuse and modularity.
3. Synchronization: The methods in the `QAPlatform` class are synchronized to handle concurrent access and ensure data consistency.

The design patterns used promote encapsulation, thread safety, and modularity. The singleton pattern ensures a single instance of the Q&A platform, while composition allows for the hierarchical structure of questions, answers, and comments. Synchronization handles concurrent access to shared data.
