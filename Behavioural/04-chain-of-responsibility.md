Explanation:
The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or the end of the chain is reached. Each handler in the chain has the opportunity to either handle the request or pass it to the next handler. This pattern promotes loose coupling by avoiding the need for the sender to know which object will ultimately handle the request.

Key Points:
- Allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers
- Each handler can either handle the request or pass it to the next handler
- Promotes loose coupling between the sender and the actual handler
- Provides flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Supports the Single Responsibility Principle by separating the handling logic

Real-Life Applications:
- Implementing a customer support system with different levels of support
- Handling user authentication and authorization in a web application
- Processing financial transactions with multiple levels of approval

Remember:
"The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is like a relay race, where each participant has the chance to handle the baton (request) or pass it to the next runner."

Sample Code:
```java
// Handler interface
interface Handler {
    void setNext(Handler handler);
    void handleRequest(String request);
}

// Concrete Handler classes
class ConcreteHandler1 implements Handler {
    private Handler nextHandler;

    public void setNext(Handler handler) {
        nextHandler = handler;
    }

    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("Request1")) {
            System.out.println("ConcreteHandler1 handled the request: " + request);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteHandler2 implements Handler {
    private Handler nextHandler;

    public void setNext(Handler handler) {
        nextHandler = handler;
    }

    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equals("Request2")) {
            System.out.println("ConcreteHandler2 handled the request: " + request);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

// Client code
class ChainOfResponsibilityDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Handler handler1 = new ConcreteHandler1();
        Handler handler2 = new ConcreteHandler2();

        handler1.setNext(handler2);

        String[] requests = {"Request1", "Request2", "Request3"};
        for (String request : requests) {
            handler1.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the Chain of Responsibility Pattern is used to handle different types of requests. The `Handler` interface defines the `setNext()` method to set the next handler in the chain and the `handleRequest()` method to handle the request. The concrete handler classes (`ConcreteHandler1` and `ConcreteHandler2`) implement the `Handler` interface and define their own logic for handling specific requests. If a handler cannot handle the request, it passes it to the next handler in the chain. The client code demonstrates how the handlers are linked together and how requests are passed through the chain until they are handled or the end of the chain is reached.
