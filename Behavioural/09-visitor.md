Explanation:
The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows defining new operations on an object structure without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. It represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing the addition of new operations without modifying the classes of the elements. The pattern involves two main components: Visitor and Element. The Visitor defines the interface for the operations to be performed on the elements, while the Element defines the accept method that takes a visitor as an argument.

Key Points:
- Allows defining new operations on an object structure without changing the element classes
- Separates the algorithm from the object structure
- Enables adding new operations easily
- Supports the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) by allowing the addition of new operations without modifying existing code
- Promotes single responsibility and encapsulation

Real-Life Applications:
- Performing operations on a complex object structure, such as an abstract syntax tree (AST) in a compiler
- Implementing a reporting system with different types of reports
- Processing and analyzing data in a hierarchical structure, such as an XML or JSON document
- Implementing a rendering system with different output formats

Remember:
"The Visitor Pattern is like a tourist who visits different cities (elements) and experiences them without the cities having to change their behavior for each tourist."

Sample Code:
```java
// Element interface
interface Shape {
    void accept(Visitor visitor);
}

// Concrete Element classes
class Circle implements Shape {
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// Visitor interface
interface Visitor {
    void visit(Circle circle);
    void visit(Rectangle rectangle);
}

// Concrete Visitor class
class AreaVisitor implements Visitor {
    public void visit(Circle circle) {
        System.out.println("Calculating area of Circle");
    }

    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {
        System.out.println("Calculating area of Rectangle");
    }
}

// Client code
public class VisitorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

        Visitor areaVisitor = new AreaVisitor();

        circle.accept(areaVisitor);
        rectangle.accept(areaVisitor);
    }
}
```

In this example, the Visitor Pattern is used to calculate the area of different shapes. The `Shape` interface represents the element and defines the `accept` method. The concrete element classes (`Circle` and `Rectangle`) implement the `Shape` interface and define their specific `accept` methods. The `Visitor` interface defines the `visit` methods for each concrete element. The `AreaVisitor` class implements the `Visitor` interface and provides the specific implementation for calculating the area of each shape. The client code demonstrates how the visitor is applied to different elements without modifying their classes.
