| Strategy Design Pattern | The Strategy Pattern is like a toolbox where you can choose the appropriate tool (algorithm) for a specific task, without changing the overall structure of your code. | [Strategy Design Pattern](03-strategy.md) |
| Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern | The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is like a relay race, where each participant has the chance to handle the baton (request) or pass it to the next runner. | [Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern](04-chain-of-responsibility.md) |
| Template Design Pattern | The Template Method Pattern is like a recipe, where the main steps are defined in the base class, and the specific ingredients can be added by the subclasses. | [Template Design Pattern](05-template.md) |
| Interpreter Design Pattern | The Interpreter Pattern is like a language translator that understands the grammar and can interpret sentences in that language. | [Interpreter Design Pattern](06-interpreter.md) |
| Command Design Pattern | The Command Pattern is like a remote control, where each button represents a command that can be executed independently of the device it controls. | [Command Design Pattern](07-command.md) |
| Iterator Design Pattern | The Iterator Pattern is like a tour guide who knows the best route to visit all the attractions without the tourists needing to know the details of the tour. | [Iterator Design Pattern](08-iterator.md) |
| Visitor Design Pattern | The Visitor Pattern is like a tourist who visits different cities (elements) and experiences them without the cities having to change their behavior for each tourist. | [Visitor Design Pattern](09-visitor.md) |
| Mediator Design Pattern | The Mediator Pattern is like a traffic control tower that manages the communication between airplanes (objects), ensuring they don't directly communicate with each other. | [Mediator Design Pattern](10-mediator.md) |
| Memento Design Pattern | The Memento Pattern is like a time machine that allows an object to travel back to its previous state without revealing the details of its journey. | [Memento Design Pattern](11-memento.md) |
