Here's a thread-safe implementation of the Uber ride problem in Java, along with explanations and driver code:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

class UberRide {
    private int democrats = 0;
    private int republicans = 0;
    private Semaphore democratsSemaphore = new Semaphore(0);
    private Semaphore republicansSemaphore = new Semaphore(0);

    public synchronized void requestRide(String party) throws InterruptedException {
        if (party.equals("Democrat")) {
            democrats++;
            if (democrats == 4 || (democrats == 2 && republicans == 2)) {
                democratsSemaphore.release(democrats);
                democrats = 0;
            }
        } else if (party.equals("Republican")) {
            republicans++;
            if (republicans == 4 || (democrats == 2 && republicans == 2)) {
                republicansSemaphore.release(republicans);
                republicans = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    public void seated(String party) throws InterruptedException {
        if (party.equals("Democrat")) {
            democratsSemaphore.acquire();
        } else if (party.equals("Republican")) {
            republicansSemaphore.acquire();
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " (" + party + ") is seated");
    }

    public synchronized void drive() {
        System.out.println("Uber ride started");
    }
}

class Rider implements Runnable {
    private UberRide uberRide;
    private String party;

    public Rider(UberRide uberRide, String party) {
        this.uberRide = uberRide;
        this.party = party;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            uberRide.requestRide(party);
            uberRide.seated(party);

            if (Math.random() < 0.25) {
                uberRide.drive();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UberRide uberRide = new UberRide();

        Thread[] riders = new Thread[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            String party = (Math.random() < 0.5) ? "Democrat" : "Republican";
            riders[i] = new Thread(new Rider(uberRide, party));
            riders[i].start();
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `UberRide` class represents the Uber ride system and manages the seating of Democrats and Republicans.
   - It keeps track of the number of Democrats and Republicans waiting for a ride using the `democrats` and `republicans` variables.
   - It uses two semaphores, `democratsSemaphore` and `republicansSemaphore`, to control the seating of riders.

2. The `requestRide()` method is called by a rider to request a ride. It takes the rider's party as a parameter.
   - If the rider is a Democrat, it increments the `democrats` count. If the count reaches 4 or if there are 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans, it releases the `democratsSemaphore` to allow the Democrats to be seated.
   - If the rider is a Republican, it increments the `republicans` count. If the count reaches 4 or if there are 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans, it releases the `republicansSemaphore` to allow the Republicans to be seated.

3. The `seated()` method is called by a rider when they are selected for the next ride. It takes the rider's party as a parameter.
   - If the rider is a Democrat, it acquires a permit from the `democratsSemaphore`, indicating that the rider is seated.
   - If the rider is a Republican, it acquires a permit from the `republicansSemaphore`, indicating that the rider is seated.
   - It prints a message indicating that the rider is seated.

4. The `drive()` method is called by any one of the seated riders to inform the driver to start the ride.
   - It prints a message indicating that the Uber ride has started.

5. The `Rider` class represents a rider thread. It implements the `Runnable` interface.
   - It takes an instance of `UberRide` and the rider's party as parameters.
   - In the `run()` method, it calls `requestRide()` to request a ride, `seated()` to indicate that the rider is seated, and randomly calls `drive()` to start the ride.

6. In the `main()` method of the `Main` class, we create an instance of `UberRide`.
   - We create an array of 10 rider threads, randomly assigning them as Democrats or Republicans.
   - We start all the rider threads.

When you run this code, you will see output similar to the following:

```
Thread-0 (Democrat) is seated
Thread-1 (Republican) is seated
Thread-2 (Republican) is seated
Thread-3 (Democrat) is seated
Uber ride started
Thread-4 (Republican) is seated
Thread-5 (Democrat) is seated
Thread-6 (Democrat) is seated
Thread-7 (Republican) is seated
Uber ride started
Thread-8 (Republican) is seated
Thread-9 (Democrat) is seated
```

The output shows that riders are seated based on the acceptable combinations (4 Democrats, 4 Republicans, or 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans), and the Uber ride starts when all the riders are seated.

The thread safety is achieved using synchronized methods and semaphores to ensure proper coordination and avoid conflicts between riders of different parties.
