    private Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(0);

    @Override
    public void execute(Runnable callback) {
        super.execute(() -> {
            callback.run();
            semaphore.release();
        });
        try {
            semaphore.acquire();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronousExecutor executor = new SynchronousExecutor();
        System.out.println("Main thread started");
        executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Callback executed"));
        System.out.println("Main thread finished");
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `AsyncExecutor` class represents the original asynchronous executor. It has an `execute()` method that takes a `Runnable` callback and executes it asynchronously using a new thread. The asynchronous work is simulated using `Thread.sleep()`.

2. The `SynchronousExecutor` class extends the `AsyncExecutor` class to make the execution synchronous without modifying the original class.
   - It uses a `Semaphore` named `semaphore` initialized with 0 permits for signaling and synchronization.

3. In the overridden `execute()` method of `SynchronousExecutor`:
   - It invokes the original `execute()` method of `AsyncExecutor` using `super.execute()`, passing a modified callback.
   - Inside the modified callback, it runs the original callback and then releases a permit on the `semaphore` using `semaphore.release()` to signal that the asynchronous execution is complete.
   - After invoking `super.execute()`, the main thread immediately tries to acquire a permit from the `semaphore` using `semaphore.acquire()`, which blocks until a permit becomes available.
   - Once the asynchronous execution is complete and the permit is released, the main thread acquires the permit and continues execution.

4. In the `main()` method of the `Main` class, we create an instance of `SynchronousExecutor` and call its `execute()` method with a simple callback that prints a message.

Output:
```
Main thread started
Async execute started
Callback executed
Main thread finished
```

Summary:

Synchronous Executor with Semaphore: Extend AsyncExecutor, use semaphore for signaling. Override execute(), invoke super.execute() with modified callback, release semaphore in callback, acquire semaphore after super.execute().

This summary captures the key points of the solution:
- Extend the `AsyncExecutor` class to create a `SynchronousExecutor`.
- Use a `Semaphore` initialized with 0 permits for signaling and synchronization.
- Override the `execute()` method, invoke the original implementation using `super.execute()` with a modified callback.
- Inside the modified callback, release a permit on the semaphore after executing the original callback.
- After invoking `super.execute()`, acquire a permit from the semaphore to block until the asynchronous execution is complete.
