Explanation:

1. The `BarberShop` class represents the barber shop with a specified number of chairs.
   - It uses a `Semaphore` named `waitingSeats` to keep track of available chairs and a `ReentrantLock` named `barberLock` to synchronize access to the barber's state.
   - The `barberAvailable` boolean variable indicates whether the barber is available or asleep.

2. The `enterShop()` method is called by customer threads to enter the barber shop.
   - If a waiting seat is available (acquired using `waitingSeats.tryAcquire()`), the customer takes a seat.
   - If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber by setting `barberAvailable` to `true` while holding the `barberLock`.
   - The customer then releases the waiting seat and proceeds to get a haircut.
   - If no waiting seats are available, the customer leaves the shop.

3. The `getHaircut()` method simulates the customer getting a haircut by sleeping for a specified duration.

4. The `barberSleep()` method is called by the barber thread to go to sleep when there are no customers.
   - It checks if all waiting seats are available, indicating no customers are present.
   - If so, the barber goes to sleep by setting `barberAvailable` to `false` and waits until a customer wakes him up.
   - The barber wakes up when `barberAvailable` becomes `true` and is ready to serve customers.

5. In the `main()` method:
   - We create an instance of `BarberShop` with 3 chairs.
   - We start the barber thread, which continuously calls `barberSleep()` to sleep when no customers are present.
   - We simulate the arrival of 5 customers by starting customer threads that call `enterShop()` with a delay of 1 second between each customer.

Summary:

Barber Shop: Use semaphore for waiting seats, lock for barber state. Customers enter shop, wake up barber if asleep, get haircut. Barber sleeps when no customers, wakes up when signaled.

This summary captures the key points of the solution:
- Use a semaphore to manage waiting seats and a lock to synchronize access to the barber's state.
- Customers enter the shop, take a seat if available, wake up the barber if asleep, and get a haircut.
- The barber goes to sleep when there are no customers and wakes up when signaled by a customer.
