Certainly! Here's a thread-safe implementation of the readers-writers problem in Java, along with explanations:

```java
class ReadWriteLock {
    private int readers = 0; // Count of readers currently reading
    private boolean writer = false; // Flag indicating if a writer is writing

    public synchronized void acquireReadLock() throws InterruptedException {
        while (writer) {
            wait(); // Wait if a writer is already writing
        }
        readers++; // Increment the count of readers
    }

    public synchronized void releaseReadLock() {
        readers--; // Decrement the count of readers
        if (readers == 0) {
            notifyAll(); // Notify waiting threads if no more readers are reading
        }
    }

    public synchronized void acquireWriteLock() throws InterruptedException {
        while (readers > 0 || writer) {
            wait(); // Wait if there are readers reading or a writer is writing
        }
        writer = true; // Set the writer flag to indicate a writer is writing
    }

    public synchronized void releaseWriteLock() {
        writer = false; // Reset the writer flag
        notifyAll(); // Notify all waiting threads
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. The `ReadWriteLock` class represents the lock mechanism for controlling access to a shared resource.

2. The `readers` variable keeps track of the number of readers currently reading the shared resource. It is initialized to 0.

3. The `writer` variable is a boolean flag that indicates if a writer is currently writing to the shared resource. It is initialized to `false`.

4. The `acquireReadLock()` method is called by a reader thread to acquire the read lock.
   - If a writer is currently writing (`writer` is `true`), the reader thread waits by calling `wait()` until the writer finishes.
   - Once no writer is writing, the reader thread increments the `readers` count to indicate that it is now reading.

5. The `releaseReadLock()` method is called by a reader thread to release the read lock.
   - It decrements the `readers` count to indicate that the reader has finished reading.
   - If the `readers` count becomes 0, meaning no more readers are reading, it calls `notifyAll()` to wake up any waiting threads (potentially writers).

6. The `acquireWriteLock()` method is called by a writer thread to acquire the write lock.
   - If there are any readers currently reading (`readers > 0`) or if a writer is already writing (`writer` is `true`), the writer thread waits by calling `wait()` until all readers finish and no writer is writing.
   - Once no readers are reading and no writer is writing, the writer thread sets the `writer` flag to `true` to indicate that it is now writing.

7. The `releaseWriteLock()` method is called by a writer thread to release the write lock.
   - It sets the `writer` flag back to `false` to indicate that the writer has finished writing.
   - It calls `notifyAll()` to wake up all waiting threads (potentially readers or other writers).

The `synchronized` keyword is used on all methods to ensure that only one thread can execute a method at a time, providing mutual exclusion and thread safety.

This implementation gives priority to readers, allowing multiple readers to read concurrently as long as no writer is writing. Writers are only allowed to write when no readers are reading and no other writer is writing.

Note: This implementation may lead to a situation known as "writer starvation" if there is a continuous stream of reader threads. In such cases, writers may have to wait indefinitely. To address this, you can modify the implementation to give priority to writers or use a fair queuing mechanism.

Certainly! Here's an example of driver code that demonstrates the usage of the `ReadWriteLock` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReadWriteLock();

        // Create multiple reader threads
        Thread[] readerThreads = new Thread[5];
        for (int i = 0; i < readerThreads.length; i++) {
            readerThreads[i] = new Thread(new Reader(lock), "Reader-" + (i + 1));
        }

        // Create a writer thread
        Thread writerThread = new Thread(new Writer(lock), "Writer");

        // Start all threads
        for (Thread thread : readerThreads) {
            thread.start();
        }
        writerThread.start();
    }
}

class Reader implements Runnable {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock;

    public Reader(ReadWriteLock lock) {
        this.lock = lock;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            while (true) {
                lock.acquireReadLock();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is reading");
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate reading time
                lock.releaseReadLock();
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate time between reads
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

class Writer implements Runnable {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock;

    public Writer(ReadWriteLock lock) {
        this.lock = lock;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            while (true) {
                lock.acquireWriteLock();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is writing");
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate writing time
                lock.releaseWriteLock();
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate time between writes
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. In the `main` method, we create an instance of the `ReadWriteLock` class named `lock`.

2. We create an array of 5 reader threads, each represented by the `Reader` class. The `Reader` class implements the `Runnable` interface and takes the `ReadWriteLock` instance as a constructor parameter.

3. We create a single writer thread, represented by the `Writer` class. The `Writer` class also implements the `Runnable` interface and takes the `ReadWriteLock` instance as a constructor parameter.

4. We start all the reader threads and the writer thread using the `start()` method.

5. In the `run()` method of the `Reader` class:
   - The reader thread enters an infinite loop.
   - It acquires the read lock by calling `lock.acquireReadLock()`.
   - It simulates reading by printing a message and sleeping for 1 second.
   - It releases the read lock by calling `lock.releaseReadLock()`.
   - It simulates time between reads by sleeping for 1 second.

6. In the `run()` method of the `Writer` class:
   - The writer thread enters an infinite loop.
   - It acquires the write lock by calling `lock.acquireWriteLock()`.
   - It simulates writing by printing a message and sleeping for 2 seconds.
   - It releases the write lock by calling `lock.releaseWriteLock()`.
   - It simulates time between writes by sleeping for 2 seconds.

When you run this code, you will see output similar to the following:

```
Reader-1 is reading
Reader-2 is reading
Reader-3 is reading
Reader-4 is reading
Reader-5 is reading
Writer is writing
Reader-1 is reading
Reader-2 is reading
Reader-3 is reading
Reader-4 is reading
Reader-5 is reading
Writer is writing
...
```

The output demonstrates that multiple readers can read concurrently, but only one writer can write at a time. The readers and writers alternate based on the availability of the lock.

Note: The example uses infinite loops and fixed sleep times for simplicity. In a real-world application, you would typically have a specific condition for terminating the threads and may use different methods for simulating reading and writing times.

Summary:
Readers-Writers Lock: readers count, writer flag; synchronized methods for acquire/release read/write locks; wait while conflicts, notify when done.

This one-line summary captures the key elements of the code:
- The lock maintains a count of readers and a flag for a writer.
- It uses synchronized methods to acquire and release read and write locks.
- Threads wait while there are conflicts (e.g., readers wait if a writer is writing).
- Threads notify others when they are done reading or writing.
