Explanation:
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It provides a step-by-step approach to construct the object, giving more control over the construction process and enabling the creation of various representations of the object using the same construction code.

Key Points:
- Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation
- Provides a step-by-step approach to construct the object
- Allows the creation of different representations using the same construction process
- Encapsulates the construction logic in a separate Builder object
- Enhances flexibility and readability of the code

Real-Life Applications:
- Building complex query statements in a database system (e.g., SQLQueryBuilder)
- Constructing different configurations of a computer system (e.g., ComputerBuilder)
- Creating various types of documents with different formats (e.g., DocumentBuilder)

Remember:
"The Builder Pattern is like a recipe for constructing complex objects, where each step can be customized to create different variations of the final product."

Sample Code:
```java
// Product class
class Computer {
    private String cpu;
    private String ram;
    private String storage;

    public void setCPU(String cpu) {
        this.cpu = cpu;
    }

    public void setRAM(String ram) {
        this.ram = ram;
    }

    public void setStorage(String storage) {
        this.storage = storage;
    }

    public String getSpecs() {
        return "CPU: " + cpu + ", RAM: " + ram + ", Storage: " + storage;
    }
}

// Builder interface
interface ComputerBuilder {
    void buildCPU();
    void buildRAM();
    void buildStorage();
    Computer getComputer();
}

// Concrete Builder classes
class HighEndComputerBuilder implements ComputerBuilder {
    private Computer computer;

    public HighEndComputerBuilder() {
        computer = new Computer();
    }

    public void buildCPU() {
        computer.setCPU("High-end CPU");
    }

    public void buildRAM() {
        computer.setRAM("16GB RAM");
    }

    public void buildStorage() {
        computer.setStorage("1TB SSD");
    }

    public Computer getComputer() {
        return computer;
    }
}

class BudgetComputerBuilder implements ComputerBuilder {
    private Computer computer;

    public BudgetComputerBuilder() {
        computer = new Computer();
    }

    public void buildCPU() {
        computer.setCPU("Budget CPU");
    }

    public void buildRAM() {
        computer.setRAM("4GB RAM");
    }

    public void buildStorage() {
        computer.setStorage("500GB HDD");
    }

    public Computer getComputer() {
        return computer;
    }
}

// Director class
class ComputerDirector {
    private ComputerBuilder computerBuilder;

    public void setComputerBuilder(ComputerBuilder computerBuilder) {
        this.computerBuilder = computerBuilder;
    }

    public Computer buildComputer() {
        computerBuilder.buildCPU();
        computerBuilder.buildRAM();
        computerBuilder.buildStorage();
        return computerBuilder.getComputer();
    }
}

// Client code
class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComputerDirector director = new ComputerDirector();

        ComputerBuilder highEndBuilder = new HighEndComputerBuilder();
        director.setComputerBuilder(highEndBuilder);
        Computer highEndComputer = director.buildComputer();
        System.out.println("High-end Computer: " + highEndComputer.getSpecs());

        ComputerBuilder budgetBuilder = new BudgetComputerBuilder();
        director.setComputerBuilder(budgetBuilder);
        Computer budgetComputer = director.buildComputer();
        System.out.println("Budget Computer: " + budgetComputer.getSpecs());
    }
}
```

In this example, the Builder Pattern is used to construct different configurations of a computer system. The `ComputerBuilder` interface defines the steps to build a computer, and the concrete builder classes (`HighEndComputerBuilder` and `BudgetComputerBuilder`) provide the actual implementation for each step. The `ComputerDirector` class controls the construction process and delegates the building steps to the selected builder. The client code creates the director, sets the desired builder, and initiates the construction process to obtain the final computer object.
