Explanation:
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows creating new objects by cloning existing objects, without depending on their specific classes. It provides a way to copy an object, including its state, without coupling the code to the object's class. This pattern is useful when creating new instances of a class is expensive or complex, and when the client code needs to create objects dynamically based on prototypes.

Key Points:
- Allows creating new objects by cloning existing objects
- Avoids coupling the client code to the specific classes of objects
- Provides a way to copy an object, including its state
- Useful when creating new instances is expensive or complex
- Enables dynamic creation of objects based on prototypes

Real-Life Applications:
- Cloning complex objects or data structures in a graphics or gaming system
- Creating new documents based on templates in a document processing application
- Duplicating database records or entities in a database management system

Remember:
"The Prototype Pattern is like using a copy machine to create identical copies of an object, avoiding the need to create objects from scratch."

Sample Code:
```java
// Prototype interface
interface Shape extends Cloneable {
    Shape clone();
    void draw();
}

// Concrete Prototype classes
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public Shape clone() {
        try {
            return (Shape) super.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            throw new AssertionError();
        }
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle with width: " + width + " and height: " + height);
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private int radius;

    public Circle(int radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public Shape clone() {
        try {
            return (Shape) super.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            throw new AssertionError();
        }
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle with radius: " + radius);
    }
}

// Client code
class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
        Shape clonedRectangle = rectangle.clone();
        clonedRectangle.draw();

        Shape circle = new Circle(15);
        Shape clonedCircle = circle.clone();
        clonedCircle.draw();
    }
}
```

In this example, the Prototype Pattern is used to clone shapes (`Rectangle` and `Circle`) without depending on their specific classes. The `Shape` interface defines the `clone()` method, which is implemented by the concrete prototype classes. The client code creates instances of the concrete prototypes and clones them using the `clone()` method, allowing the creation of new objects with the same state as the original objects.
